# NZClimateCourse
A climate change/modeling course to be taught in New Zealand. This
seems like a great course to teach in New Zealand. I'll have a
collection of students from several majors, and I think it'd be a ton
of fun to do some basic climate modeling in Python. We should be able
to have computational resources such that everyone has a laptop +
internet connection.

# Collecting resources

## Climate change/modeling resources


 * [Scientists develop tool which can predict coastal erosion and recovery in extreme storms](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171011091718.htm)
 * The Carleton materials for
   [Climate of Change: Interactions and Feedbacks between Water, Air, and Ice](https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/climate_change/index.html)
   look awesome, and come highly recommended.
 * I really enjoyed the materials from the EdX course
   [Making Sense of Climate Science Denial](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UQx+Denial101x+2T2015/course/)
   ... this would be an awesome thing to do near the end of the
   course. Lots of GenEd properties as well.
 * [Physics for Future Presidents](http://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/PffP.html)
   has a chapter on climate change.
 * [David Archer](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/david-archer/)
   has created two free Coursera classes:
   [Global Warming I: The Science and Modeling of Climate Change](https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming)
   and
   [Global Warming II: Create Your Own Models in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-warming-model#syllabus)
   so that seems pretty relevant!
