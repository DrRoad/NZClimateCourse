# Course Design Goals

This course may be the most science-heavy course, and it will have a high level of academic rigor. So, it might be a good idea to have the students involved in the design of the learning goals. This will generate buy-in. It will also require some careful guidance, as the students won't have quite the right background to design all of the learning goals.
